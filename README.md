## Vantiro 1.1v06b
### Improvements from previous version (1.1v05b):
- Amazing Lighting. (still WIP!)
- Better zombie path finding.
- Small optimizations.
- Fixed UI Issues due to hardware images.
- New map. (cave map, using minecraft's textures for now.)
- Map selector when clicking play. (Place holder for a better one still to be made.)
- New per map tilesets.
- Flashlight. (press Y or U to adjust strength.)
- New loading screen. (Will be removed when I bake the lighting to the map.)
- New weapon: Chainsaw. (Still WIP, no textures.)
- New debug info.

### How to spawn zombies and work with path finding:
 Pathfinding is still limited, to load the pathfinding file you need to enable DEBUG (F3 key) and hit F7 to load the waypoints, to validate them and to set a goal for zombies you need to press '\*' (The numpad '\*'.) and then you can spawn the zombies with the hammer.
