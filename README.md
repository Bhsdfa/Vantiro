## Vantiro 1.1v05b
### Improvements from previous version (1.1v04b):
- Almost all images changed to hardware images. (BIG FPS BOOST, I didn't know that existed before)
- Better performance when rendering: zombies, fire, smoke, particles, TILES and player.
- New debug graphs to show what is lagging the game. (MOUSE3 to hold and move them)
- A new Linux release.

This version has some UI bugs and visual differences due to the changes to images, they will be fixed in the future when I get everything figured out.
